Grape leaf disease detection uses advanced image processing and deep learning techniques for automated identification and classification of diseases. The code processes high-resolution images of grape leaves to detect diseases like powdery mildew and downy mildew. It utilizes image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to provide accurate and efficient diagnosis, enabling timely interventions to protect grapevine health and optimize crop yield.
